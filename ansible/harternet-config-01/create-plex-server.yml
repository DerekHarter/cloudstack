# At this point the plex media server is running and plex media is mounted.
# The next step is to configure the server and add libraries.  I don't know
# how to access plexmediaserver from the command line to do these tasks, most
# install walk throughs show using the web based access to configure media.
# One note, this configuration has to be run on a browser that is actually
# running locally on the plex server machine, which we can't do since this
# is setup as a server.  So need to create a http tunnel from localhost to
# configure media libraries, like this:
#
# $ ssh 192.168.0.158 -L 8888:localhost:32400
# $ ssh -i keys/ansiblemanagement.key -oIdentitiesOnly=yes ubuntu@192.168.0.157 -L 8888:localhost:32400
# This creates a tunnel locally on port 8888 to the plex web server serving on port 32400
# at the public ip we just created and assigned to the server (change 192.168.0.158
# for the allocated ip).
#
# Also need to connect to:
#
#    http://localhost:8888/web
#
# the first time.
