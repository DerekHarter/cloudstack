# Apache CloudStack Setup, Configuration and Documentation Project

Project for setting up 
[Apache CloudStack](https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/latest/index.html) clouds.  

Currently this project has notes, scripts and references for setting up CloudStack cloud computing
environments.  This work currently targets both notes and materials for my own at home usage.
But we are also targeting setting up an Apache cloud on the Texas A&M University - Commerce
(TAMUC) HPC server rack hardware.  The current tlc (TAMUC Lion Cloud) has been using
[OpenStack Cloud Configuration](https://www.openstack.org/) 
for about 2 years.  We are prototyping Apache CloudStack to possibly replace this system.
